# development teams

Here you'll find the definition of the developer workloads.

Despite both teams sharing the very same supplychain, because each team is
equiped with the best knowledge of how to run testing pipelines for their

like to have executed for a particular stage pre-defined by the app operator
team.

- [development team 1](./dev-1)
- [development team 2](./dev-2)
