# cluster setup

Aside from having [cartographer] and pipeline-service installed in the cluster,
here we also pre-load a secret with some credentials so anyone running this
example can get [kpack] to build and push the image to a sample repository in
https://harbor-repo.vmware.com.

Nothing interesting to see here regarding pipeline-service.
